# Current status
- Works perfectly
- Pushed to Github
- I can use ngrok to test the API endpoint locally if needed
    - If ngrok gets disconnected, I need to get a new ngrok URL and enter it into Make.com
    - To get a new ngrok URL, I need to run `ngrok http 3000` in the terminal
- The Make.com scenario is here: https://eu2.make.com/507916/scenarios/3387603/edit

# Plan
- Add genuine entries for a week
- See how the insights work and tweak the prompt as needed

# Roadmap
- Add name mappings to context:
    - Add name_mappings column to user_context table
    - Update context form to manage name mappings
    - Include name context in OpenAI prompts
    - Help LLM disambiguate names and provide person context
- Add a chat history
- Add API key check to Make.com to prevent abuse
- Add pre-set prompts (like "What have I been doing?")
- Add a "user info" screen that gets pulled into the prompt with extra context:
    - Goals
    - Projects
    - Life info
    - Etc
- Move the Telegram integration into the app to remove the need for Make.com
- Add the ability to switch models on the front end
- Make the API return a success/failure message to Telegram
    - It already shows on the front end so must be there already in some form

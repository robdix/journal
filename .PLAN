# Current status
- Works perfectly
- Pushed to Github
- I can use ngrok to test the API endpoint locally if needed
    - If ngrok gets disconnected, I need to get a new ngrok URL and enter it into Make.com
    - To get a new ngrok URL, I need to run `ngrok http 3000` in the terminal
- The Make.com scenario is here: https://eu2.make.com/507916/scenarios/3387603/edit

# Plan
- Add genuine entries for a week
- See how the insights work and tweak the prompt as needed

# Roadmap
- Fix the Make.com voice note API confirmation â€“ it works for text but not voice
- Add API key check to Make.com to prevent abuse
- Move the Telegram integration into the app to remove the need for Make.com
- Add the ability to switch models on the front end
